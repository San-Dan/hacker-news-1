### Code Review by Sandra Danielsson
  1. Adding the keyword exit; after your header()-functions increases user security, 
      killing the current script before the redirect.
  2. Use snake-case och camelCase in file names as well for readability.
  3. Adding error and confirmation messages helps reducing mistakes and uncertainty.
  4. Good and clear project structure!
  5. The helping comments in editprofile.php are appreciated and good for navigating. It could be 
      a good idea adding it to other long files such as functions.php
